jtorchat2 - the rewrite
=======================
To build jtorchat you need JRuby and bundler.

Once you have installed JRuby just install bundler with the following command:

```
jruby -S gem install bundler
```

Once you have everything setup, just run the following commands

```
bundle install
rake
```

This will create a jtorchat.zip with the jar and the start scripts.
